    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounded rationality, as proposed by Herbert Simon, challenges the notion of human rationality and differs from the concept of a traditional homo-economicus. In line with this thinking, McKelvey and Palfrey (1995) made available a model named Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) that considers an agent who sometimes makes mistakes. As behavioral economists, we are interested in knowing the different results that can be obtained by solving the game with two approaches. The first approach is the Nash Equilibrium in Pure and Mixed Strategies and the second approach is through the QRE. The first assumes perfect rationality while the second considers agents’ mistakes. While both approaches are different we want to analyze the magnitude of difference and determine how can an agent ‘learn’ to reach a NE in mixed strategies.  \n"

    "We will assume an X value (player 1 payment for selecting Up) of 2. Later on we may play with the model in order to see whether this value makes a difference and the probable magnitude of these differences. In the beginning we will assume that the value of lambda ()will equal 1. Later on we may play with this value as well and analyze how the NE for the LQRE tends to the mixed strategy NE. \n",
